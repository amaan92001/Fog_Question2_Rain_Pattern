# 🌧️ Rain Pattern Simulation Assessment - FOG
![FOG LOGO](https://production-cuvette.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/company/65f310bd234f0ea0ee8ec597/logo.jpg?d=1710430443716)  

Welcome to the **Rain Pattern Simulation** project! This repository provides a creative solution to simulate a rain pattern effect using JavaScript and HTML canvas. Ideal for exploring fundamental concepts in graphics and animation, this project visualizes rain droplets to create a realistic rain effect, which can be used in web applications or as an interactive visual feature.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

This project features a dynamic rain animation where "raindrops" fall across the screen, each with random positions, speeds, and sizes to mimic natural rain. The animation is built on:

- **ReactJS and JavaScript** for raindrop behavior and animation.
- **HTML Canvas** for rendering graphics directly in the browser.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To get started with the Rain Pattern Simulation, follow these steps:

1.## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/amaan92001/Fog_Question2_Rain_Pattern.git
cd Fog_Question2_Rain_Pattern
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then run:
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. **Watch the Rain**:
   The rain animation should start automatically. You can customize the rain behavior by adjusting parameters in the JavaScript file (such as raindrop speed, size, and frequency).

## 🎨 Features

- **Realistic Rain Effect**: Randomized speed, size, and position of raindrops for a natural look.
- **Interactive Canvas**: Users can enjoy a seamless animation without performance lag.

---

## 🛠️ Customization

You can adjust parameters in `script.js`:

- **Rain Speed**: Modify `drop.speed` to control how fast the raindrops fall.
- **Rain Density**: Change the number of drops for heavier or lighter rain.
- **Color and Style**: Customize raindrop color to blend with your project’s theme.
